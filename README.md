# JavaScript Promises: A Comprehensive Guide

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to understanding and using JavaScript promises. The guide includes detailed explanations and example code for the following types of promises:

- `Promise.all`
- `Promise.race`
- `Promise.any`
- `Promise.allSettled`

## Overview

Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They provide a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.
